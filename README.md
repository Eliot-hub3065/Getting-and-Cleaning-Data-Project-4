README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created. tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set. CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data). run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set (see the Creating the data set section below) Study design

The source data set that this project was based on was obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, which describes how the data was initially collected as follows:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
